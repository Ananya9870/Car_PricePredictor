# ðŸš— Car Price Predictor

**Car_PricePredictor** is a machine learning project designed to predict the selling price of used cars based on features such as brand, model, fuel type, mileage, and more. This project uses Python and various regression models to determine the best approach for accurate price prediction.

Developed and executed using Google Colab.
